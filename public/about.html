<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! My name is Andrew Kim and I am a Software Engineering with professional
  experience in handling backend work for e-commerce businesses. I have
  experience coding in Python and Java, mainly handling ETL pipelines through
  custom code hosted on both Mulesoft Cloudhub and Microsoft Azure. I am
  currently aspiring to become a Web Developer as well by taking the Full-Stack
  Web Devloper course on Udemy by Dr. Angela Yu.

  I enjoyed my time working and refining my skills as a backend developer, but I
  want to broaden my horizons and tackle the idea of becoming a full-stack
  developer. Whether this becomes a simple passion project or side hobby, I want
  to take it seriously and see what I can accomplish. So far, I am just learning
  the basics, but I want this project and personal website to evolve into a
  website I can show off and be proud of.

  Some things I am passionate about outside of software development is golf,
  working out, and enjoying good food. I am currently a 9.7 handicap on
  18Birdies and my goal in the next year is to become a 5 handicap. My goal in
  the gym is to hopefully bench 255 at some point in the near future. I stopped
  powerlifting for a couple years due to the toll it takes on my lower back, but
  I want to slowly get back into incorporating it into my workouts to reach my
  personal goals. As for food, I am not a picky eater whatsoever. I can eat
  almost all things and will never say no to trying something new. My favorite
  food at the moment is Katsu Curry.
